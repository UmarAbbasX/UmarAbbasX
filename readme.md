# Hi, I'm Umar Abbas

Building reliable web systems with a backend-first approach.

## About Me

I'm a full-stack developer who works on both backend and frontend, but I'm more comfortable with backend development. 
I mostly use PHP to build secure and well-structured systems that are easy to maintain. On the frontend, I use Tailwind CSS to keep things clean and consistent, and I also work with Alpine.js and Livewire when needed. 
Iâ€™ve built modern interfaces using Angular and have used React in some projects too. I also build Android apps using Java. 
I enjoy managing full projects from setting up the database to writing backend logic, designing the frontend, and handling deployment.
